# Predicting Nightly Price of Toronto's Airbnb Listings 

## The objectives of is project are:  
-	To explore and analyze Airbnbâ€™s listings in Toronto, Canada
-	To identify features that affect the prices of a nightly stay
-	To develop machine learning models that predict the prices of a nightly stay based on relevant features
- Provide recommendations for hosts to increase their revenues

## Significance of this project:  
By thoroughly examine Toronto's Airbnb market dataset, we will identify the important features that affect pricing, which the hosts can use as a reference to modify their properties or booking policy. We will also develop machine learning models that can be used by the hosts to set fair and competitive prices.
